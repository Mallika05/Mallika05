<h2>üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Cybersecurity Experience</h2>

- <b>Cybersecurity Analyst @ City of Vancouver | 2020 - Present</b></br>
As a pivotal member of the Cybersecurity Team, I help my team triage and orchestrate responses to security alerts and incidents. My role extends beyond incident handling, encompassing initiatives aimed at fortifying the security posture of the City. I thrive on collaborative endeavors with my teammates and regularly engage in cybersecurity projects. Application Security has emerged as one of my profound interests, prompting me to actively engage with developers in identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities within web applications. 
    
- <b>Security Analyst @ Kobalt Security Inc., Vancouver | 2019 - 2020 </b></br>
I first embarked into Cybersecurity with an abundance of curiosity and aspirations at Kobalt. This startup venture laid a solid foundation for my career where I was honored to work alongside industry experts. I contributed to the establishment of a Security Operations Center from its nascent stages. My responsibilities included SIEM management, log analysis, creation of detection use cases, ingestion and monitoring of firewalls, SaaS, and cloud security sources. I excelled in customer onboarding, dashboarding, threat intelligence integration and automating security event response. Additionally, my role also entailed client consultations on various security topics.

- <b>Security Analyst Intern @ Council of Information Security,  New Delhi</b></br>
At CIS, after some great hands-on training on OSINT techniques and finding vulnerabilities like SQL injection, I was able to effectively carry out vulnerability testing of client websites. Additionally, I was tasked with training 4 new interns on fundamentals of Networking - Routing and Switching, where I incorporated hands-on practical labs using GNS3 and Wireshark. I also helped develop virtualization and SDN technology instruction guides.

- <b>Web Developer Intern @ Armor5, New Delhi</b></br>
At Armor5 (Acquired by Digital Guardian), I contributed in the designing and development of a web application from scratch using -> A Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and integration with backend MySQL database designed using Entity-Relationship modelling.
