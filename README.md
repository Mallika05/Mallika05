<h2>üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Cybersecurity Experience</h2>

- <b>Cybersecurity Analyst @ City of Vancouver | 2020 - Present</b></br>
I am a member of the Cybersecurity Team where I help my team triage security alerts and respond to incidents. Besides digging into incidents and alerts, I also work on projects to amp up security for the City and collaborate with teammates on various new projects. Application Security is another area I have developed immense interest in and I find pleasure in teaming up with developers to find and remediate web app vulnerabilities. I use a variety of tools and scripting and programming languages at my job, including: 
    - EDRs,
    - SIEM,
    - Firewalls,
    - Cloud Security,
    - DAST scanning,
    - Vulnerability Management systems,
    - Powershell,
    - Python,
    - And a few query languages.
    
- <b>Security Analyst @ Kobalt Security Inc. | 2019 - 2020 </b></br>
This was my first job in Cybersecurity, YAY! When I was fresh out of school with a lot of curiosity and dreams to make a career in security, I got to realize those at this new Startup in Vancouver. I was the first Security Analyst on the team and experienced working with some super smart people in the industry. This experience included supporting the building of a Security Operations Center from the ground up. All this exposure proved invaluable for setting up my foundation for my future endeavors.
